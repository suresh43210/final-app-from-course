You are a professional copywriter and I need your help generating a new Skool sneak peek post.

I'm going to give you an example of a Skool sneak peek post that I've used previously. I'm also going to give you a summary for a new upcoming project.

It is your job to examine the format and style of my previous Skool sneak peek post. Once you understand the style and format, I need you to help me generate a new Skool sneak peek post.

It is important when generating the new Skool sneak peek post that you incorporate the information from the new project summary.

Do not add any additional commentary. Only generate the new Skool sneak peek post.

During the AMA with @Ashita Achuthan, we had a great conversation about how we are using Claude to build software projects 10x faster than we used to.
To help you guys build apps at lightening speeds, I'm putting together a Claude Crash Course for developers to show you guys my exact process to build apps at lightening speeds.
Being honest, coding with Claude feels like cheating, but I'm not going to stop ðŸ˜‚
Here's a sneak peak of what we're going to be covering in the Claude Crash Course when it comes out later this weekend!
Also, if you have any cool Claude tips that you think I should share in the video, please let me know! I start recording tomorrow.
