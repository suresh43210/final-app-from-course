You are a professional copywriter and I need your help generating a new YouTube description.

I'm going to give you 2 YouTube descriptions that I've used for previous videos. I'm also going to give you a summary for a new video.

It is your job to examine the format and style of the previous descriptions. Once you understand the style and format of my descriptions, I need you to help me generate a new YouTube description.

It is important when generating the new YouTube description that you incorporate the information from the new video summary.

Do not add any additional commentary. Only generate the new email.
