You are a professional copywriter and I need your help generating a new YouTube sneak peek post.

I'm going to give you an example of a YouTube sneak peek post that I've used previously. I'm also going to give you a summary for a new upcoming project.

It is your job to examine the format and style of my previous YouTube sneak peek post. Once you understand the style and format, I need you to help me generate a new YouTube sneak peek post.

It is important when generating the new YouTube sneak peek post that you incorporate the information from the new project summary.

Do not add any additional commentary. Only generate the new YouTube sneak peek post.

Claude 3.5 Crash Course Sneak Peak

During the AMA with Ashita Achuthan, we had a great conversation about how we are using Claude to build software projects 10x faster than we used to.

To help you guys build apps at lightening speeds, I'm putting together a Claude Crash Course for developers to show you guys my exact process to build apps at lightening speeds.

Being honest, coding with Claude feels like cheating, but I'm not going to stop ðŸ˜‚

Here's a sneak peak of what we're going to be covering in the Claude Crash Course when it comes out later this weekend!

Also, if you have any cool Claude tips that you think I should share in the video, please let me know! I start recording tomorrow.

Groq + CrewAI Tutorial Coming Out Soon

Hey guys! I just finished recording a Groq + CrewAI tutorial for y'all!

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to optomize your Crews to use Groq. I also cover some of the common problems you'll face using Groq and how you can work around them.

Here's why I think you'll love this tutorial when it comes out!
1) You're going to learn how to build cruise that run super fast and completely for FREE.
2)In the tutorial, you learn how to build a crew that sends personalized called outreach emails to future clients.

Simply put, we are builing a crew that takes in 2 pieces of information:
1) A CSV that contains people we want to talk with a little bit of information about them
2) A general template containing the information we want to share with that person

Our Crew will mix all this information together to generate a personalized email that talks exactly how you and I would talk to some one.

What's cool is that you can use this Crew yourself to do cold outreach to offer your services as an AI Implementer. Or, you could work with businesses that already do cold out reach and help them do even more outreach with AI.

Either way, you win and you have an opportunity to start making money with AI!

And, because you guys are awesome, I'll be giving away the source code for free per usual!

As soon as my editor get's the video together, I'll post it for y'all! I'm hoping this video will come out Saturday morning!

P.S.

The video after this one is gong to be HUGE!!!! I'll share more information about it next week.

I just finished coding up the new NextJS + CrewAI Full Stack project for you guys!

The project consists of a NextJS front end that allows you to enter companies and positions you want to research.

When you run a job, it sends over the positions and company to the CrewAI backend. This will kickoff a crew to do the research.

From there, the front end project continually polls the status of the crew so you can see the crew making progress in real time.

When the crew finishes, it spits out an output containing all the researched companies with blog articles and YouTube videos about the people in each position.

Right now, this project will only run locally on your computer. If you guys really like this kind of project and the video get's a lot of engagement, I'll make another version that's hosted in the cloud. That way other users can access the full stack CrewAI project.

I'm going to start recording now! Video should be out Tuesday morning!

Can't wait for you guys to level up your CrewAI + full stack skills!
