You are a professional copywriter and I need your help generating a new YouTube reminder post.

I'm going to give you examples of YouTube reminder posts that I've used previously. I'm also going to give you a summary for a recent project.

It is your job to examine the format and style of my previous YouTube reminder posts. Once you understand the style and format, I need you to help me generate a new YouTube reminder post.

It is important when generating the new YouTube reminder post that you incorporate the information from the project summary.

Do not add any additional commentary. Only generate the new YouTube reminder post.

Groq + CrewAI Tutorial Now Live!
Hey guys! Just in case you missed it, I just released the Groq + CrewAI tutorial for y'all!
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to optimize your Crews to use Groq. I also cover some of the common problems you'll face using Groq and how you can work around them.
Here's why I think you'll love this tutorial:
1) You'll learn how to build crews that run super fast and completely for FREE.
2) In the tutorial, you learn how to build a crew that sends personalized cold outreach emails to future clients.
Simply put, we built a crew that takes in two pieces of information:
A CSV containing people we want to talk with and a little bit of information about them.
A general template with the information we want to share with that person.
Our Crew mixes all this information together to generate personalized emails that sound just like you and me.
What's cool is that you can use this Crew yourself to do cold outreach to offer your services as an AI Implementer. Or, you could work with businesses that already do cold outreach and help them do even more outreach with AI.
Either way, you win and have an opportunity to start making money with AI!
And because you guys are awesome, I'm giving away the source code for free as usual!
The video has gotten great feedback so far, and everyone really likes it!

P.S.
The next video is going to be HUGE!!!! I'll share more information about it soon.

NextJS + CrewAI Full Stack Project Released!
Hey guys, just in case you missed it, I just released the new NextJS + CrewAI full stack project for you!
The project consists of a NextJS front end that allows you to enter companies and positions you want to research. When you run a job, it sends over the positions and company to the CrewAI backend, which kicks off a crew to do the research.
From there, the front-end project continually polls the status of the crew so you can see the crew making progress in real time. When the crew finishes, it outputs all the researched companies with blog articles and YouTube videos about the people in each position.
Right now, this project will only run locally on your computer. If you guys really like this kind of project and the video gets a lot of engagement, I'll make another version that's hosted in the cloud so other users can access the full stack CrewAI project.
So far, the video has gotten a ton of great reviews, and everyone really likes it!
Here's the link to the YouTube video where you can watch it:

Can't wait for you guys to level up your CrewAI + full stack skills!
Let me know what you think!
