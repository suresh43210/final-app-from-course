Hey [FIRST NAME GOES HERE]!

I’m super excited to announce that I’ve just released a brand-new tutorial on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the AI community. This video is packed with practical insights and examples that I think you’re going to love!

video preview​
Here's a breakdown of what you can expect from this tutorial:

Introduction to RAG: Understand what RAG is and how it works, especially when integrated with CrewAI.

Basic Code Example: Get hands-on experience by setting up a crew that works with home inspection reports to generate work order emails for contractors. This example will help you get comfortable with RAG and CrewAI, particularly when dealing with large PDFs.

Advanced Code Example: This is where it gets really exciting! Dive deep into more complex applications with a YouTube scraping RAG tool, Firecrawl (the best web scraping tool for AI agents). You’ll learn how to build your own tools and implement advanced RAG techniques like the follow-up and fallback method. This part of the tutorial is packed with powerful techniques and cutting-edge tools that will take your AI skills to the next level!

What you'll love this tutorial awesome:

Step-by-Step Guidance: Learn everything from foundational concepts to expert-level skills.
Practical Use Cases: Dive into real-world projects that you can implement immediately.
Cutting-Edge Tech: Explore the newest AI tools and techniques that will elevate your work.
