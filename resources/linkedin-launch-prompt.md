You are a professional copywriter and I need your help generating a new LinkedIn post.

I'm going to give you 2 LinkedIn posts that I've used for previous videos. I'm also going to give you a summary for a new video.

It is your job to examine the format and style of the previous LinkedIn posts. Once you understand the style and format of my LinkedIn posts, I need you to help me generate a new LinkedIn post.

It is important when generating the new LinkedIn post that you incorporate the information from the new video summary.

Do not add any additional commentary. Only generate the new LinkedIn post.
